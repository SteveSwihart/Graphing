# Graphing
## Description
These 2 folders are for 2 different brands of UV LEDs I did lifetime testing on, in my garage, during the pandemic.

Eotron was my first significant python graphing task. I learned from it.

Violumas started a few months later

## Files
for Eotron, run "Eotron, All Charts.py", and have "EotronDataAferPoint245.txt", "Spectral Scan, 1-Jul-20,270-290.txt" and "Fiber Spec Scan After 640 Hrs, 1 sec.txt" present. First txt is the starting LED spectra, and Those are all that's needed.

for Violumas, run "ViolumasTriColorV3.1_Graphs.py", and have "ViolumasTriColorV3.1Data.txt" and "Violumas3_1_LED_Spectral_Data.txt" present.
